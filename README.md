Creating a data dashboard for Career Foundry Exercise 6.7

<p>Objective</p>
<p>To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p> You’ll first conduct an exploratory visual analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then, after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.</p>
<p>Data Set</p>
<p> Brazilian e-commerce order data from Olist Store, with 100K+ orders from 2016-2018 across multiple marketplaces.
